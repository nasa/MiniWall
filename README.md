MiniWall
=======
Tool for investigating and extracting knowledge from large image data sets.


### Introduction
The MiniWall software is browser-based software that is used
to analyze and understand large and small computationally and
experimentally generated data sets.  The MiniWall software presents
a matrix view of plots and other visualization images and provides
a responsive and productive way to investigate the data and extract
knowledge and understanding from it.  Since it is browser based,
it runs on any computer or device that can display a web page.
It can also be used remotely and securely by using web server
software such as the Apache HTTP Server.
