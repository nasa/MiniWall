    <h1>MiniWall Software Release</h1>
    <p>
      The MiniWall software is browser-based software that is used
      to analyze and understand large and small computationally and
      experimentally generated data sets.  The MiniWall software presents
      a matrix view of plots and other visualization images and provides
      a responsive and productive way to investigate the data and extract
      knowledge and understanding from it.  Since it is browser based,
      it runs on any computer or device that can display a web page.
      It can also be used remotely and securely by using web server
      software such as the Apache HTTP Server.
