    <h1>MiniWall Software Release - gh-pages branch</h1>
    <p>
      The MiniWall software is browser-based software that is used
      to analyze and understand large and small computationally and
      experimentally generated data sets.  The MiniWall software presents
      a matrix view of plots and other visualization images and provides
      a responsive and productive way to investigate the data and extract
      knowledge and understanding from it.  Since it is browser based,
      it runs on any computer or device that can display a web page.
      It can also be used remotely and securely by using web server
      software such as the Apache HTTP Server.
    </p>
    <p>
      The MiniWall software was originally written by John
      Melton in 2006 using a combination of HTML, JavaScript, and Microsoft's ActiveX
      software. Paul Stremel rewrote it in 2012 using modern JavaScript and HTML
      standards which enabled it to be run on non-Microsoft Windows-based
      computers.  Michael Schuh rewrote it in 2014 using JavaScript objects
      and extended the MiniWall software to have additional functionality
      that easily accommodates different usages. While it currently <b>works
      best with the Google Chrome</b> browser, it could be updated to run
      well under additional browsers such as Firefox, Internet Explorer,
      and Microsoft Edge.

           January 2017 AIAA paper.  By reading this paper and trying out the sample
           MiniWall below, you should be able to assess if a MiniWall would work for your
           application.

    <h3>Sample MiniWall</h3>
    <p>
      The <a href="data/Paper-MiniWall_Version_3.3_20170124_AIAA_Final.pdf">AIAA MiniWall
           paper</a> has screen shots from a sample
      <a href="miniWall/MiniWall_vent_paper.html">MiniWall</a> that was created for
      analyzing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) results from an investigation of
      a novel rocket venting design for the NASA Space Launch
      System (SLS) program.  The project involved using CFD to predict the performance
      of different vent configurations at different rocket speeds and pressure ratios.  The sample
      <a href="miniWall/MiniWall_vent_paper.html">MiniWall</a> includes images
      from CFD simulations of 3.6 inch, 5.0 inch, and 7.2 inch diameter vents with
      square honeycomb materials in a vent that is inclined in the direction of the flow.
      When the rocket is perched on the launch pad, the space between the outer skin of a rocket and the internal components, such as the
      fuel tanks, is filled with air at atmospheric pressure.  As the rocket
      climbs up in the atmosphere the pressure outside of the rocket decreases and eventually
      goes to zero when the rocket is in outer space.  The vents allow the air inside the rocket skin
      to flow to the outside to avoid pressure building up under the skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sample
      <a href="miniWall/MiniWall_vent_paper.html">MiniWall</a> includes images
      for Mach 0.9 and 1.4.  The Mach Number is the ratio of the rocket speed to the speed
      of sound in the air outside of the rocket.
      The Mach 0.9 simulation results for the 3.6, 5.0, and 7.2 inch diameter vents are
      in the first three rows in the sample
      <a href="miniWall/MiniWall_vent_paper.html">MiniWall</a>.  They are followed by
      the results for the same vent sizes at Mach 1.6.  The columns have seven different pressure
      ratios that represent the internal pressure divided by the external pressure.
      As the pressure ratio is increased, the faster the internal air will flow
      through the vent.  The images for each simulation start out with some summary images
      that allow the researcher to quickly look through the key results.  These are followed
      by more detailed investigations of the surface pressure, Mach Number, velocity, temperature, tube pressure,
      air flow visualization, and convergence results.  The Pressure Ratio 1.20 results
      in the fourth column also have images showing the mesh.  Some of the images show cuts
      through the honeycomb vent and at locations slightly outside and inside of the
      rocket skin.  Again, see the
